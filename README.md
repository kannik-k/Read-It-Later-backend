# Read It Later

## Overview

This is a backend application built with Java and Gradle. This README will guide you through the steps to build, run, and Dockerize the application.

## Project introduction

ReadItLater is a platform that allows users to make a personal wishlist of books they want to read in the future. Users can add books to the website for everyone to see and they can also add them to their wishlist. There’s an option to search for books by genre—by selecting a genre, users can view books belonging to it. Books can also be searched by author or title. Clicking on a book allows users to see available reviews for that book. Users can set their favorite genres, which are used to provide personalized book recommendations. Each recommendation also includes the option to view reviews related to the book.
